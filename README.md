# Class Imbalance Handling in Machine Learning

This repository presents a comparative study of different **sampling techniques**
for handling class imbalance and their impact on various machine learning models.

## 📊 Sampling Techniques
- No Sampling (Baseline)
- Random Under Sampling
- Random Over Sampling
- SMOTE
- NearMiss

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## 🏆 Key Finding
Tree-based models combined with **Random Over-Sampling and SMOTE**
achieved the highest accuracy and better class separation
for the imbalanced fraud detection dataset.
